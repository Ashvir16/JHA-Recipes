<u><b>INGREDIENTS:</b></u>
<br>
  <ul class = ingredientList>
<li class = "ingredientText"> 4 part eggs to 1 part oil (or melted butter) </li>
<br>
<li class = "ingredientText"> 1 part milk </li>
<br>
<li class = "ingredientText"> 1 part cake flour </li>
<br>
<li class = "ingredientText"> 1 part sugar. (A large egg minus its shell is generally ~50 grams.) </li>
<br>
<li class = "ingredientText"> 1/2-1g salt per egg  </li>
<br>
<li class = "ingredientText"> vanilla (or some other extract) </li>
<br>
<li class = "ingredientText"> cream of tarter (~1g for every four eggs) </li>
<br>
    <li class = "ingredientText"> 1/10th the weight of the flour in corn starch (optional). </li>
<br>

<u><b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b></u>
<br>
<u>Method:</u>
<ol class = "instructionList">
<li class = "instruction"> Make one egg's worth of batter for every 22 inches (360 cm) of pan volume.</li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction">You'll need big pan and an even bigger pan you can nest it into. </li> 
  <br>
<li class = "instruction">With the pans nested, pour enough water into the bigger pan to come at least halfway up the sides of the smaller pan.  </li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction"> Take the smaller pan out, and put the bigger pan (with the water) into your oven. </li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction"> Start the oven heating to 325 F (160 C) — no convection fan, unless you prefer a dry, cracked top. (If using convection, probably lower the heat to 300 F, 150C.)</li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction"> Coat all interior sides of the smaller pan with parchment paper. Leave enough excess that you can grab to sling the cake out when it's done.</li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction"> Separate all the eggs into two large bowls. Into the bowl with the yolks, put the oil (or melted butter), milk, flour, salt, cornstarch (if using — it makes the interior crumb finer), and a big glug of vanilla or any extract you're using.  </li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction"> Weigh out the sugar in a separate bowl — I like to use a little more than 1 part sugar, but all of these proportions can be altered to various effects.</li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction"> Put the cream of tarter into the egg whites and beat them until they're very fluffy.</li>
  <br>
<li class = "instruction"> Beat in the sugar in a couple installments until you have medium peaks — or stiff peaks if you want an even puffier cake, though that will likely result in a cracked top.</li>
  <br>
  <li class = "instruction"> Beat the yolk mixture until smooth. Gradually combine the white mixture and the yolk mixture until homogenous.</li>
  <br>
  <li class = "instruction"> Pour the batter into the parchment-lined cake pan, and drop the pan into the water bath in the oven. (Don't worry if it splashes — steam is good for cakes.) </li>
  <br>
  <li class = "instruction"> Bake until a skewer to the center comes out clean — probably at least an hour, though it will depend on the size.</li>
  <br>
  <li class = "instruction"> When the cake is done, use the parchment as a sling to lift it out before slicing with the longest knife you have.</li>
  <br>
